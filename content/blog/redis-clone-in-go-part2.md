title: "Making A Redis Clone For Learning Go - Part 2"

Learning a programming language while doing a project would be much easier than simply learning the syntax or taking long courses and making notes. So this is my attempt at learning Go while creating a redis clone.

*Note:* I'll ignore error handling in most of the cases while including code here(even if go compiler doesn't like it), however the full code with better error handling is in my repo: [manu156/redisClone](https://github.com/manu156/redisClone)
