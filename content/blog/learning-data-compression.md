1.3. Modeling is Not Computable
We modeled the digits of π as uniformly distributed and independent. Given that model, Shannon's coding theorem places a hard limit on the best compression that could be achieved. However, it is possible to use a better model. The digits of π are not really random. The digits are only unknown until you compute them. An intelligent compressor might recognize the digits of π and encode it as a description meaning "the first million digits of pi", or as a program that reconstructs the data when run. With our previous model, the best we could do is (106 log2 10)/8 ≈ 415,241 bytes. Yet, there are very small programs that can output π, some as small as 52 bytes.
